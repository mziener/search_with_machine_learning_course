For query classification:

How many unique categories did you see in your rolled up training data when you set the minimum number of queries per category to 1000? To 10000?

With the threshold of 1000 I get 389 categories with the threshold of 10000 I get 73 categories.

What were the best values you achieved for R@1, R@3, and R@5? You should have tried at least a few different models, varying the minimum number of queries per category, as well as trying different fastText parameters or query normalization. Report at least 2 of your runs.

With the vanilla (standard parameters without tuning) model on 389 categories I get the following values for R@1, R@3 and R@5: 0.481, 0.633, 0.697.
With 25 epochs and -wordNgrams 2 on 398 Categories I get the following values: R@1 0.527, R@3 0.714, R@5 0.776 with a large increase in training time.
-wordNgrams 3 produced similar results with a lower training time.

For integrating query classification with search:

Give 2 or 3 examples of queries where you saw a dramatic positive change in the results because of filtering. Make sure to include the classifier output for those queries.

More Iphones, less gadgets for iphones due to the right category applied.

Even after extensive search I struggle to find an example where I get multiple classifications. I believe that such an example should improve the results.


Give 2 or 3 examples of queries where filtering hurt the results, either because the classifier was wrong or for some other reason. Again, include the classifier output for those queries.
